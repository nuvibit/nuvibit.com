It is recommended to provision all resources used for the **Foundation Core Capabilities** via **[Infrastructure as Code](/faq/#iac 'What is Infrastructure as Code?')**. Nuvibit made great expirience in leveraging [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html 'Introduction to Terraform').

Nuvibit is specialized in introducing the **Core Capabilities** of a **Corporate Cloud Foundation** to companies.

We will tailor our Foundation Core Terraform modules to your needs and enable you to serve the **Foundation Capabilities** to your **Cloud Workload Development Teams** in a high maturity.

**[Contact](/contact/ 'Contact us for more information!')** us for further details.
