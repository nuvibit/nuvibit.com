## 2\. Processing of personal data

### 2.1 Terms

**Personal data** is _any_ information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. A **data subject** is a person about whom we process personal data.

**Processing** includes _any_ handling of personal data, _regardless_ of the means and procedures used, such as querying, matching, adapting, archiving, storing, reading, disclosing, procuring, recording, collecting, deleting, disclosing, organizing, storing, modifying, disseminating, linking, destroying and using personal data.

The **European Economic Area (EEA)** includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Member States of the European Union</a> (EU) as well as the Principality of Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) refers to the processing of personal data as processing of personal data.

### 2.2 Legal basis

We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law such as, in particular, the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/491/de" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" id="45254">Federal Data Protection Act</a> (Data Protection Act, DPA) and the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/568/de" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data Protection Ordinance</a> (Data Protection Ordinance, DPA).</p>

We process - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - personal data in accordance with _at least_ one of the following legal bases:

* <a href="https://steigerlegal.ch/dsgvo/dsgvo-6/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO</a> for the necessary processing of personal data for the performance of a contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject prevail. Legitimate interests include, in particular, our interest in being able to carry out our activities and operations permanently, in a user-friendly, secure and reliable manner, as well as to communicate about them, to ensure information security, to protect against misuse, to enforce our own legal claims and to comply with Swiss law.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject under any applicable law of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA).
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO for the processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.


## 3\. Type, scope and purpose

We process those personal data that are _necessary_ to carry out our activities and operations in a durable, user-friendly, secure and reliable manner. In particular, such personal data may fall into the categories of inventory and contact data, browser and device data, content data, meta or marginal data and usage data, location data, sales data, and contract and payment data.

We process personal data for the _period_ necessary for the relevant purpose(s) or as required by law. Personal Data whose processing is no longer necessary will be anonymized or deleted.

We may have personal data processed _by third parties_. We may process personal data jointly with third parties or transmit it to third parties. Such third parties are, in particular, specialized providers whose services we use. We also guarantee data protection for such third parties.

We process personal data _in principle_ only with the consent of the persons concerned. If and to the extent that the processing is permitted for other legal reasons, we may refrain from obtaining consent. For example, we may process personal data without consent in order to fulfill a contract, to comply with legal obligations or to protect overriding interests.

In this context, we process in particular information that a data subject _voluntarily_ provides to us when contacting us - for example, by mail, email, instant messaging, contact form, social media or telephone - or when registering for a user account. We may store such information, for example, in an address book, in a customer relationship management system (CRM system) or with comparable tools. If we receive data about other persons, the transmitting persons are obligated to ensure data protection with respect to these persons as well as to ensure the accuracy of this personal data.

We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain from publicly available sources or collect in the course of our activities and operations, if and to the extent that such processing is permitted for legal reasons.


## 4\. Personal data abroad

We process personal data _in principle_ in Switzerland and in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we may also export or transfer Personal Data to other countries, in particular to process it or have it processed there.

We may export Personal Data to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states#List_of_states" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states and territories on Earth</a> and elsewhere in the <a href="https://www.datenschutzpartner.ch/2022/04/23/datenschutzerklaerung-daten-export-universum-mond/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universe</a>, provided that the law there is in compliance with <a href="https://steigerlegal. ch/2022/09/10/ndsg-schweiz-staatenliste/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision of the Swiss Federal Council</a> and - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - according to <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision of the European Commission</a>.

We may transfer personal data to countries whose laws do not ensure adequate data protection, provided that data protection is ensured for other reasons, in particular on the basis of standard data protection clauses or with other appropriate safeguards. By way of exception, we may export personal data to countries without adequate or appropriate data protection if the special data protection law requirements for this are met, for example the express consent of the data subjects or a direct connection with the conclusion or performance of a contract. We will be happy to provide data subjects with information about any safeguards or provide a copy of any safeguards upon request.


## 5\. Rights of data subjects

### 5.1 Data protection rights

We grant data subjects all claims in accordance with applicable data protection law. In particular, data subjects have the following rights:

* **Information:** Data subjects may request information as to whether we process personal data about them, and if so, what personal data is involved. Data subjects also receive the information necessary to assert their data protection rights and to ensure transparency. This includes the personal data processed as such, but also, among other things, information on the purpose of processing, the duration of storage, any disclosure or export of data to other countries and the origin of the personal data.
* **Correction and restriction:** Data subjects may have inaccurate personal data corrected, incomplete data completed and the processing of their data restricted.
* Data subjects can have personal data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and object to the processing of their data with effect for the future.
* **Data release and data transfer:** Data subjects may request the release of personal data or the transfer of their data to another data controller.

We may suspend, restrict or refuse the exercise of data subjects' rights to the extent permitted by law. We can inform data subjects of any requirements that must be met in order to exercise their rights under data protection law. For example, we may refuse to provide information in whole or in part with reference to business secrets or the protection of other persons. We may also, for example, refuse to delete personal data in whole or in part with reference to statutory retention obligations.

We may _exceptionally_ provide for costs for the exercise of rights. We inform data subjects in advance of any costs.

We are obliged to take appropriate measures to identify data subjects who request information or assert other rights. Data subjects are obliged to cooperate.

### 5.2 Right of complaint

Data subjects have the right to enforce their data protection claims through legal channels or to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.

The data protection supervisory authority for private data controllers and federal bodies in Switzerland is the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a> (FDPIC).

Data subjects have - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - the right to lodge a complaint with a competent <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European data protection supervisory authority</a>.

Data subjects whose personal data we process have rights under Swiss data protection law. These include the right to information as well as the right to correction, deletion or blocking of the personal data processed.


## 6\. Data security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security appropriate to the risk involved. However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security.

Access to our website is made by means of transport encryption (TLS, in particular with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS). Most browsers mark transport encryption with a padlock in the address bar.

Our digital communication is subject - like _basically_ any digital communication - to mass surveillance without cause or suspicion and other monitoring by security authorities in Switzerland, the rest of Europe, the United States of America (USA) and other countries. We cannot directly influence the corresponding processing of personal data by secret services, police agencies and other security authorities.


## 7\. Use of the website

### 7.1 Cookies

We may use cookies. Cookies - our own cookies (first-party cookies) as well as cookies from third parties whose services we use (third-party cookies) - are data that are stored in the browser. Such stored data need not be limited to traditional cookies in text form.

Cookies can be stored in the browser temporarily as "session cookies" or for a certain period of time as so-called permanent cookies. "Session cookies" are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent cookies have a specific storage period. In particular, cookies enable us to recognize a browser the next time it visits our website and thus, for example, to measure the reach of our website. However, permanent cookies can also be used for online marketing, for example.

Cookies can be completely or partially deactivated and deleted at any time in the browser settings. Without cookies, our website may no longer be fully available. We actively request - at least if and to the extent necessary - the express consent to the use of cookies.

In the case of cookies used for performance and reach measurement or for advertising, a general objection ("opt-out") is possible for numerous services via the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AdChoices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada), the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (NAI), <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YourAdChoices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance) or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/ch-de/praferenzmanagement" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, EDAA) are possible.

### 7.2 Server log files

We may record the following information for each access to our website, provided that this information is transmitted by your browser to our server infrastructure or can be determined by our web server: Date and time including time zone, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access status (HTTP status code), operating system including user interface and version, browser including language and version, individual sub-page of our website accessed including amount of data transferred, website last accessed in the same browser window (referer or referrer).

We store such information, which may also constitute personal data, in server log files. The information is necessary to provide our website permanently, user-friendly and reliably, as well as to ensure data security and thus in particular the protection of personal data - also by third parties or with the help of third parties.

### 7.3 Tracking pixel

We may use tracking pixels on our website. Tracking pixels are also referred to as web beacons. Tracking pixels - including those from third parties whose services we use - are small, usually invisible images that are automatically retrieved when you visit our website. Counting pixels can be used to collect the same information as in server log files.


## 8\. Social media

We are present on social media platforms and other online platforms in order to communicate with interested persons as well as to inform them about our activities and operations. In connection with such platforms, personal data may also be processed outside of Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA).

The General Terms and Conditions (GTC) and Terms of Use as well as data protection declarations and other provisions of the individual operators of such platforms also apply in each case. These provisions inform in particular about the rights of data subjects directly against the respective platform, which includes, for example, the right to information.


## 9\. Third party services

We use services of specialized third parties in order to be able to carry out our activities and operations in a durable, user-friendly, secure and reliable manner. Such services allow us, among other things, to embed features and content on our website. In the case of such embedding, the services used record the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the users at least temporarily for technically compelling reasons.

For necessary security-related, statistical and technical purposes, third parties whose services we use may process data in connection with our activities and operations in aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized form. This is, for example, performance or usage data in order to be able to offer the respective service.

In particular, we use:

For participation in audio and video conferences, the legal texts of the individual services such as privacy statements and terms of use apply in addition.

Depending on the life situation, we recommend muting the microphone by default when participating in audio or video conferences, as well as blurring the background or fading in a virtual background.

In particular, we use:

## 10\. Success and reach measurement

We try to determine how our online offer is used. As part of this, we may, for example, measure the success and reach of our activities and operations, as well as the impact of third-party links to our website. But we can also, for example, try out and compare how different parts or versions of our online offering are used ("A/B test" method). Based on the results of the success and reach measurement, we can in particular correct errors, strengthen popular content or make improvements to our online offering.

In most cases, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of individual users are stored for success and reach measurement. In this case, IP addresses are _generally_ shortened ("IP masking") in order to follow the principle of data economy through the corresponding pseudonymization.

Cookies may be used and user profiles may be created when measuring success and reach. Any user profiles created include, for example, the individual pages visited or content viewed on our website, information on the size of the screen or browser window and the - at least approximate - location. As a matter of principle, any user profiles are created exclusively on a pseudonymous basis and are not used to identify individual users. Individual services of third parties to which users are logged in can, if necessary, assign the use of our online offer to the user account or user profile at the respective service.

We use in particular:

* **<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Tag Manager:</a>** Integration and management of other services for performance and reach measurement as well as other services from Google as well as third parties; provider: Google; Google Tag Manager-specific information: <a href="https://support. google.com/tagmanager/answer/9323295?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"Data collected with Google Tag Manager"</a>; further information on data protection can be found with the individual integrated and managed services.

We may adjust and amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will inform about such adjustments and additions in an appropriate form, in particular by publishing the respective current privacy policy on our website.
