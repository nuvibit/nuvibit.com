    content: "Even a cloud network engineer can struggle to calculate subnets by hand. This calculator is tailored to support you when defining your AWS network architecture.<br><br>
    Enter a network range (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24) and decide whether it should be divided evenly by cidr (e.g. 26) or variably (e.g. 26,26,28,28)."
