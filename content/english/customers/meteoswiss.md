The Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology observes the weather around the clock, creating weather forecasts and alerting authorities and population, when strong winds, heavy rainfall, storms or heat waves are forecast. 
In addition, it provides weather services for the civil, military and private aviation. 

The office also carries out a program of research and development to understand the weather and climate in the Alps.

### How did we help?

MeteoSwiss embarked on a transformative journey to migrate around 200 applications to AWS. 
They faced the monumental task of setting up a compliant and scalable AWS Landing Zone & Foundation to support their critical operations.

By implementing [NTC (Nuvibit Terraform Collection)](/solutions/terraform-collection 'What is NTC?'), the transformation was simply remarkable. 
NTC enabled MeteoSwiss to quickly establish an advanced AWS Landing Zone & Foundation with minimal time and effort.

The platform team can now shift their focus towards empowering solution teams and driving innovation, rather than starting from scratch to build a complex AWS Foundation. 
NTC not only streamlined their infrastructure but also equipped their teams with the essential skills to excel on AWS.

MeteoSwiss is now ready to face any forecast and meet any challenge in the cloud.
