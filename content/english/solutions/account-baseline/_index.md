    content: "Before deploying a productive workload on the public cloud there are many moving parts which have to be coordinated. 
    There are technical parts such as connectivity or security and organizational parts such as finance or operations.
    A secure, scalable cloud foundation will significantly accelerate your cloud adoption journey and is one of the most important and hardest challenges.<br/><br/>
    Our Foundation Blueprint addresses exactly this concern and enables your organization to efficiently build a tailored Cloud Foundation."
