about_us:
  introduction: "Nuvibit was founded by a group of cloud enthusiasts who were eager to take on a fresh challenge.<br>
                Originally, the founding members worked for the same company in different departments.
                Right after the company announced it's cloud strategy, we were tasked with building a cloud foundation on AWS.
                We poured our blood, sweat, and tears into it and managed to achieve an outstanding level of maturity.<br>
                Each and every one of us has gone above and beyond, which ultimately led to the idea of starting a company with like-minded, motivated people."
