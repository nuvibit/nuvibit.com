## 2\. Processing of personal data

### 2.1 Terms

**Personal data** is _any_ information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. A **data subject** is a person about whom we process personal data.

**Processing** includes _any_ handling of personal data, _regardless_ of the means and procedures used, such as querying, matching, adapting, archiving, storing, reading, disclosing, procuring, recording, collecting, deleting, disclosing, organizing, storing, modifying, disseminating, linking, destroying and using personal data.

The **European Economic Area (EEA)** includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Member States of the European Union</a> (EU) as well as the Principality of Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) refers to the processing of personal data as processing of personal data.

### 2.2 Legal basis

We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law such as, in particular, the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/491/de" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" id="45254">Federal Data Protection Act</a> (Data Protection Act, DPA) and the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/568/de" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data Protection Ordinance</a> (Data Protection Ordinance, DPA).</p>

We process - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - personal data in accordance with _at least_ one of the following legal bases:

* <a href="https://steigerlegal.ch/dsgvo/dsgvo-6/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO</a> for the necessary processing of personal data for the performance of a contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject prevail. Legitimate interests include, in particular, our interest in being able to carry out our activities and operations permanently, in a user-friendly, secure and reliable manner, as well as to communicate about them, to ensure information security, to protect against misuse, to enforce our own legal claims and to comply with Swiss law.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject under any applicable law of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA).
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO for the processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject.
* Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO for the necessary processing of personal data to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.

## 3 Type, scope and purpose

We process those personal data that are _necessary_ to carry out our activities and operations in a durable, user-friendly, secure and reliable manner. In particular, such personal data may fall into the categories of inventory and contact data, browser and device data, content data, meta or marginal data and usage data, location data, sales data, and contract and payment data.

We process personal data for the _period_ necessary for the relevant purpose(s) or as required by law. Personal Data whose processing is no longer necessary will be anonymized or deleted.

We may have personal data processed _by third parties_. We may process personal data jointly with third parties or transmit it to third parties. Such third parties are, in particular, specialized providers whose services we use. We also guarantee data protection for such third parties.

We process personal data _in principle_ only with the consent of the persons concerned. If and to the extent that the processing is permitted for other legal reasons, we may refrain from obtaining consent. For example, we may process personal data without consent in order to fulfill a contract, to comply with legal obligations or to protect overriding interests.

In this context, we process in particular information that a data subject _voluntarily_ provides to us when contacting us - for example, by mail, email, instant messaging, contact form, social media or telephone - or when registering for a user account. We may store such information, for example, in an address book, in a customer relationship management system (CRM system) or with comparable tools. If we receive data about other persons, the transmitting persons are obligated to ensure data protection with respect to these persons as well as to ensure the accuracy of this personal data.

We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain from publicly available sources or collect in the course of our activities and operations, if and to the extent that such processing is permitted for legal reasons.

## 4\. Personal data abroad

We process personal data _in principle_ in Switzerland and in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we may also export or transfer Personal Data to other countries, in particular to process it or have it processed there.

We may export Personal Data to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states#List_of_states" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states and territories on Earth</a> and elsewhere in the <a href="https://www.datenschutzpartner.ch/2022/04/23/datenschutzerklaerung-daten-export-universum-mond/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universe</a>, provided that the law there is in compliance with <a href="https://steigerlegal. ch/2022/09/10/ndsg-schweiz-staatenliste/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision of the Swiss Federal Council</a> and - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - according to <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision of the European Commission</a>.

We may transfer personal data to countries whose laws do not ensure adequate data protection, provided that data protection is ensured for other reasons, in particular on the basis of standard data protection clauses or with other appropriate safeguards. By way of exception, we may export personal data to countries without adequate or appropriate data protection if the special data protection law requirements for this are met, for example the express consent of the data subjects or a direct connection with the conclusion or performance of a contract. We will be happy to provide data subjects with information about any safeguards or provide a copy of any safeguards upon request.

## 5\. Rights of data subjects

### 5.1 Data protection rights

We grant data subjects all claims in accordance with applicable data protection law. In particular, data subjects have the following rights:

* **Information:** Data subjects may request information as to whether we process personal data about them, and if so, what personal data is involved. Data subjects also receive the information necessary to assert their data protection rights and to ensure transparency. This includes the personal data processed as such, but also, among other things, information on the purpose of processing, the duration of storage, any disclosure or export of data to other countries and the origin of the personal data.
* **Correction and restriction:** Data subjects may have inaccurate personal data corrected, incomplete data completed and the processing of their data restricted.
* Data subjects can have personal data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and object to the processing of their data with effect for the future.
* **Data release and data transfer:** Data subjects may request the release of personal data or the transfer of their data to another data controller.

We may suspend, restrict or refuse the exercise of data subjects' rights to the extent permitted by law. We can inform data subjects of any requirements that must be met in order to exercise their rights under data protection law. For example, we may refuse to provide information in whole or in part with reference to business secrets or the protection of other persons. We may also, for example, refuse to delete personal data in whole or in part with reference to statutory retention obligations.

We may _exceptionally_ provide for costs for the exercise of rights. We inform data subjects in advance of any costs.

We are obliged to take appropriate measures to identify data subjects who request information or assert other rights. Data subjects are obliged to cooperate.

### 5.2 Right of complaint

Data subjects have the right to enforce their data protection claims through legal channels or to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.

The data protection supervisory authority for private data controllers and federal bodies in Switzerland is the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a> (FDPIC).

Data subjects have - if and to the extent that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable - the right to lodge a complaint with a competent <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European data protection supervisory authority</a>.

Data subjects whose personal data we process have rights under Swiss data protection law. These include the right to information as well as the right to correction, deletion or blocking of the personal data processed.

## 6\. Data security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security appropriate to the risk involved. However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security.

Access to our website is made by means of transport encryption (TLS, in particular with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS). Most browsers mark transport encryption with a padlock in the address bar.

Our digital communication is subject - like _basically_ any digital communication - to mass surveillance without cause or suspicion and other monitoring by security authorities in Switzerland, the rest of Europe, the United States of America (USA) and other countries. We cannot directly influence the corresponding processing of personal data by secret services, police agencies and other security authorities.

## 7\. Performance and reach measurement

We use services and programs to determine how our online offering is used.
